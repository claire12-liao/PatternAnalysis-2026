# Current assessment alignment and evidence boundaries

Yuhan Liao - 49839991 - 26 October 2026

Checked against the user-supplied **Final Report Assessment v2.5**, Sections 2.1, 3-6 and Appendix A.6, including the later supplied PDF with the same relevant body. Classroom tips are applied as engineering guidance; they are not substituted for the official rubric. Feasibility completion is student-confirmed. This is an evidence map, not a prediction of marks or approval by the teaching team.

## Formal marking criteria

| Criterion | Marks | Current evidence and remaining boundary |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| 1.1 Appropriate solution | 5 | Native two-layer GCN solves the four-class transductive task; matched MLP, calibration and runnable review rules are evaluated. Original zero-threshold routing failure, class trade-offs and residual high-confidence errors remain disclosed. No zero-error claim. |
| 1.2 PyTorch/TF implementation works | 3 | Explicit PyTorch training and reloads; real GPU/CPU experiments, 26 targeted tests, two new complete saved-model replays and two tamper-rejection checks. These are particular checks, not exhaustive correctness. |
| 1.3 Design quality | 1 | Separate model/data/training/evaluation/prediction; training-only scaling, sparse graph normalisation, bound saved policies, protected output paths. |
| 1.4 Comments/readability | 1 | English docstrings and protocol boundaries; source roles in README; [each-test explanation](verification_guide.md). New model computations use Torch. |
| 1.5 Normal or above | 5 | The specified FacebookPagePage task with actual multi-layer neighbour aggregation and 128-dimensional features is implemented. |
| 1.6 Hard | 5 | Not applicable to this Normal GNN. Additional analyses or an ensemble do not change its difficulty classification. |
| 2.1 Meaningful commit messages/originality | 2 | Real progressive source/experiment/document commits, cited methods and broad AI disclosure. Commit existence does not independently prove authorship; the student remains responsible for understanding and permitted use. |
| 2.2 Progressive logical history | 3 | Original planning/data/prototype/GPU/report work and later evidence-based refinements have separate actual milestones. History is preserved, not backdated. |
| 3.1 Principles and problem | 5 | README explains GCN equations, data, transductive scope, fairness, all required metrics, embedding interpretation, original five failures, additional five politician cases, calibration diagnostics, measured costs and engineering choices. |
| 3.2 Usage and script comments | 3 | Exact executed versions, reproducible commands, expected inputs/outputs, saved-model requirements and data/weight exclusions. Each added policy has a runnable bound replay; new paths protect prior runs. |
| 3.3 GitHub Markdown | 2 | Headings, tables, relative images/links and source references. Formal PDF is exported from the same current README and visually checked. |
| 4.1 Correct working PR by deadline | 2 | Existing PR #9 targets upstream `topic-recognition`; final remote file identities and source ZIP are checked after sync. The exact personal deadline/time is governed by Blackboard. |
| 4.2 Incorporate/respond to review | 2 | Current read-only API check found no reviews, review comments or discussion comments. This is a future phase, not completed in advance. Actual feedback must be addressed during the announced window. |
| 4.3 Professional PR description | 1 | Description states task, implementation, benchmark, reproducibility, negative findings, evaluation limits and AI assistance; updated to final scope. |

Normal implementation is capped at 15/20; the overall structural maximum is 35/40 if all other criteria receive full marks. This is a cap, not an awarded or predicted grade.

## Required GNN investigation and delivery

| Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Correct dataset and PyG container | Pinned modified course FacebookPagePage; SHA256, numeric validation, 22,470 x 128 features, PyG Data. Upstream supplied SVD construction is explicitly not claimed as train-only. |
| Leakage boundary | Transductive features/edges visible; labels never enter forward or messages. Scaling uses training nodes; selection, temperature, policy and final roles are separated in the follow-up. Previously inspected graph/final outcomes remain post-hoc. |
| Implemented baseline/same splits | Matched feature-only MLP and GCN, same original evaluation masks, matched width/parameter count and three initialisations. Later comparisons identify their different split/test sizes. |
| Quantitative metrics | Accuracy, per-class precision/recall/F1, Macro-F1, macro OVR AUROC, calibration and coverage/error counts. No class metric is replaced by a whole-population score. |
| Embedding | Ground-truth-coloured t-SNE for MLP/GCN, with critical interpretation and stated projection limits. |
| Resource profile | Original A100 parameter/peak VRAM/latency table; additional consensus CPU cost is scoped separately, without claiming an unmeasured ensemble GPU profile. |
| 3-5 failure autopsies | Original five real cases remain; additional selected politician cases distinguish observations, hypotheses and fixed-weight graph sensitivity. Shared confident errors and no-incremental gate result are retained. |
| Actionable recommendation | Retain the simpler single-GCN research replay. Six-member pooling has modest post-hoc gains, 6.23x CPU latency and no additional gate benefit; not automatically adopted from inspected scores. New data/content review is needed before reliability claims. |
| Mandatory architecture | `modules.py`, `dataset.py`, `train.py`, `predict.py`, `README.md` in `recognition/Facebook_GCN/`; model components use only Torch. Helpers do not replace these required files. |
| Feasibility review/hurdle | Historical one-page review included in README; check-off confirmed by student, without fabricating an institutional receipt. |
| AI disclosure | Dedicated exact required heading states tools, broad tasks, verification and student responsibility; includes new CPU analysis/diagnosis. |
| Git exclusions | No raw data, trained weights, split IDs or full per-node labelled exports in repository or source ZIP. Private evidence archived separately. |
| Turnitin | Current PDF is prepared from README. A successful institutional receipt has not been provided; this workflow does not claim submission or infer non-submission. |
| Prior assessed work | If code is reused from an earlier assessed demo, the specification requires a substantially different final model. No prior assessed codebase was supplied for independent comparison; a feasibility prototype alone is not evidence of an earlier graded demo. |

## Classroom tips addressed

- A concrete protocol precedes each new experiment; roles and constraints are fixed and outcomes preserved.
- Each test has a purpose and boundary; a passing suite is not a substitute for real error analysis.
- Negative attempts are part of the record: zero threshold, below-target seeds, precision loss, worsened politician ECE, shared errors and no observed unanimity gain.
- Actual staged commits, modular structure, README/PDF consistency and a professional PR preserve reviewability.
- Cost and fallback choices are measured; no additional school GPU quota is required for the saved-model refinement.
- AI assistance is disclosed broadly, and no automated workflow can substitute for the student's understanding.

External data, page-content/annotation investigation, human-review effectiveness, Turnitin receipt and future formal reviewer responses cannot be manufactured by code or report edits. Ed has no supplied reply; no replacement threshold is described as teaching-team approved. Colab stays unchanged under the student's explicit instruction.
